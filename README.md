#Sentiment Analysis with NLTK
This Python script performs sentiment analysis on user reviews using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) sentiment analysis tool provided by the NLTK library. The script allows you to input a review and categorizes it as positive, negative, or neutral based on its sentiment score.

Setup and Usage
Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

shell
Copy code
>>pip install nltk
Import the necessary modules in your Python script:

python
Copy code
>>import nltk
>>from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

Use the get_sentiment() function to analyze the sentiment of a review:

>>review = input("Enter your review: ")
>>sentiment = get_sentiment(review)
>>The function takes the review as input and returns the sentiment as "Positive," "Negative," or "Neutral."

The positive feedback is stored in the pos list, and the negative feedback is stored in the neg list.

Customize the code as needed for your specific use case.

Example
Here's an example usage of the sentiment analysis script:

>>python
Copy code
review = input("Enter your review: ")
sentiment = get_sentiment(review)
print("Sentiment:", sentiment)
print("Positive feedback:", pos)
print("Negative feedback:", neg)
