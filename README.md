1.The code imports the necessary libraries:

>>code

import nltk

from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

*nltk is the Natural Language Toolkit library that provides tools and resources for working with human language data in Python.

*SentimentIntensityAnalyzer is a class from the nltk.sentiment module that performs sentiment analysis using the VADER lexicon.

2.The next line downloads the VADER lexicon, which is a pre-trained model for sentiment analysis provided by NLTK:

>>code

nltk.download('vader_lexicon')

*This ensures that the VADER lexicon is available for sentiment analysis.

3.The code defines a function called get_sentiment(review):

>>code

def get_sentiment(review):

    sid = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
    
    sentiment_scores = sid.polarity_scores(review)
    
    compound_score = sentiment_scores['compound']
    
    if compound_score >= 0.05:
    
        pos.append(review)
        
        return 'Positive'
    
    elif compound_score <= -0.05:
    
        neg.append(review)
        
        return 'Negative'
    
    else:
        
        return 'Neutral'

*This function takes a review as input and returns the sentiment label ('Positive', 'Negative', or 'Neutral') based on the sentiment score of the review.


*It creates an instance of SentimentIntensityAnalyzer called sid.


*The polarity_scores() method of sid is called on the review to obtain sentiment scores, including positive, negative, neutral, and compound scores.


*The compound score represents the overall sentiment of the review. If it is greater than or equal to 0.05, the review is considered positive and is appended to the pos list. If it is less than 

or equal to -0.05, the review is considered negative and is appended to the neg list. Otherwise, the review is considered neutral.

The corresponding sentiment label ('Positive', 'Negative', or 'Neutral') is returned.

4.The code prompts the user to enter a review:

>>code

review = input("Enter your review: ")

*This line prompts the user to enter a review, which will be used for sentiment analysis.

5.The code initializes two empty lists, pos and neg, to store positive and negative feedback:

>>code

pos, neg = [], []

*These lists will be populated with reviews that are classified as positive or negative.

6.The code analyzes the sentiment of the review using the get_sentiment() function:

>>code

sentiment = get_sentiment(review)

*The get_sentiment() function is called with the user-provided review, and the resulting sentiment label ('Positive', 'Negative', or 'Neutral') is stored in the sentiment variable.

7.The code prints the positive and negative feedback based on the sentiment score:

>>code

print('Positive feedback:', pos)

print('Negative feedback:', neg)

*These lines print the reviews that have been classified as positive and negative, respectively, based on the sentiment analysis.
